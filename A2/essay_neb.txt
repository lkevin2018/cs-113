Albuquerque is my turkey and he's feathered and he's fine, And he
wobbles and he gobbles and he's
absolutely mine

He's the best pet you can get yet better than 
a dog or cat, He's my albuquerque turkey and i'm awfully proud of that

Albuquerque is my turkey and he's happy in his bed, 'Cause for
our thanksgiving dinner we'll have sphagetti instead
